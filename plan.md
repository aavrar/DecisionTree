# DecisionTree: Choice Architecture Visualizer - Enhanced Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This updated plan transforms DecisionTree into a cutting-edge 2024-2025 decision-making tool that combines sophisticated psychology-informed design with advanced technical implementation. The approach emphasizes human-centered design, emotional intelligence, and modern visual trends while maintaining robust technical foundation.

## Design Philosophy Integration (2024-2025)

### Core Design Principles
- **Glassmorphism + Selective Claymorphism**: Frosted glass effects for decision hierarchies with soft, rounded 3D nodes
- **Psychology-Informed Interface**: Balancing visceral, behavioral, and reflective processing levels  
- **Calm Technology**: Information flows smoothly between center and periphery without overwhelming users
- **Accessibility-First**: Beyond WCAG compliance to genuinely inclusive experiences

### Visual Design Implementation
- **Color Psychology**: Blue for trust/logic (financial decisions), earth tones for balance (long-term planning)
- **Typography**: Variable fonts (Neue Montreal) with dynamic hierarchy adaptation
- **Dark Mode**: Sophisticated implementation using #121212 with 4.5:1 contrast ratios
- **Micro-interactions**: AI-powered personalization with GSAP/Framer Motion integration

### Emotional Context Integration
- Emotional state indicators (confidence level sliders, urgency assessments)
- Multi-dimensional sliders controlling multiple variables simultaneously
- Progressive disclosure limited to 2-3 levels maximum to prevent confusion
- Peak-end rule optimization for decision completion experiences
